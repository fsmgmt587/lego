President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is willing to fight to achieve all its objectives if Ukraine does not agree to a deal.

He made the remarks in China after attending a huge military parade seen as a challenge to Donald Trump and the US-dominated world order.

The US president has tried to persuade Putin to end the war, but the Russian leader, while praising Trump's "sincere desire", has so far not done so.

Visiting Kyiv, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told the BBC Trump had brought Putin to the table, and had not ruled out putting more pressure on him.

Countries like the UK, he said, were willing "to put extra economic pressure on Putin... and to give extra aid to Ukraine so they can keep in the fight".

Trump pulled Putin out of international isolation last month when he hosted a meeting with him in Alaska.

He also tried to persuade Putin to meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"I have never ruled out the possibility of such a meeting. But is there any point? Let's see," Putin said on Wednesday.

He added that any such meeting required preparation to yield results, and that Zelensky could always go to Moscow to see him – a "knowingly unacceptable" idea, Ukraine's foreign minister was quick to point out.

Ukraine's president has been highlighting Putin's refusal to meet as a way of urging Trump to impose sanctions on Russia and boost Ukraine's defences.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.

Later on Wednesday Trump said the Russian leader "knows where I stand" regarding an end to the war.

"I have no message to President Putin, he knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other," Trump told reporters at the White House, where he was hosting recently-elected Polish President Karol Nawrocki.

He bristled at a reporter who suggested he had not taken significant action against Moscow, citing secondary sanctions on India for buying Russian oil.

"You call that no action? And I haven't done phase two and phase three yet," added Trump, without elaborating.

Asked by a Russian state TV journalist in Beijing whether the war in Ukraine could end soon, the Russian leader said "there is a certain light at the end of the tunnel".

"It seems to me that if common sense prevails, it will be possible to agree on an acceptable solution to end this conflict," Putin said. "If not, then we will have to resolve all our tasks militarily."

But he went on to stress that Russia would not relinquish the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine his troops have seized.

The Russian leader repeated his demands for Ukraine not to seek Nato membership and to stop what he called discrimination against ethnic Russians – one of the allegations mentioned as a pretext for the invasion.

Putin hinted that Western security guarantees after a future peace deal would not relate to the Donbas areas whose inhabitants had opted to join Russia – a reference to widely-criticised votes held in the aftermath of the annexation.

Putin met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Beijing, after which Kim said North Korea would continue to "fully support" Russia's army as a "fraternal duty".

According to North Korean state media, Putin thanked Kim for providing troops for Russia's war effort in Ukraine and described relations between the two countries are "special ones of trust, friendship and alliance".
